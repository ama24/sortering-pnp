# CLAUDE.md — sortering-pnp

sortering-pnp runs on the Raspberry Pi next to Klipper and turns the printer into a pick-and-place
screw sorter. It is the only repository the Pi needs. Its two siblings run on a PC:
[screw-synth](https://github.com/ama24/screw-synth) makes the synthetic training data and
[training-synth](https://github.com/ama24/training-synth) trains the models. The three exchange
files only, and each one works without the others:
- a model package (training-synth, often a GitHub release: weights, `model_card.json`,
  `classes.yaml`, `parts.json`) is uploaded in the Models tab;
- the camera calibration (`calibration.json`) and real-photo sessions made here go to screw-synth.
Never import screwsynth or another sibling package, and never read their folders.

**sortering-pnp is the only program that moves the printer.** The camera calibration and real-photo
sessions are pages of sortering-pnp (`photos.py`: Calibrate and Photos tabs), with the camera in
`camera.py`/`camlock.py`, the one-button calibration in `calibjob.py`, the calibration maths in
`calib/` and the session format in `session.py`. The camera stays open (`CameraVision._camera`,
automatic settings until locked) with a second 1280x720 stream for the live picture
(`/api/camera/live.mjpg`, only while the Camera Calibration tab is open).
Never add another program or path that sends G-code.

**sortering-pnp runs on its own.** It never reads the other repositories' folders for data: files
from them (vision.yaml, parts.json, classes.yaml, items.json, calibrations) are dropped in the web
page's Files tab (`files.py`, kept in `paths.files`; order: the active model's package (parts,
classes) > dropped > machine.yaml path > `defaults/` that come with sortering-pnp > none, and every
slot says what happens without it). Models come
through the Models tab, and models from anywhere else must keep working. A new file it needs
gets a slot in `files.SLOTS` (where to find it, used for, without it), never a path into
another repository.

## Workflow
- All code lives on `main`. Each piece of work gets a short-lived branch (`feature/<name>`,
  `fix/<name>`), a pull request into `main`, and is deleted after merging. Never push to `main`
  directly.
- Run `pytest` and `ruff check .` (and `ruff format --check .`) before every commit.

## Design
- **Printer:** Klipper through Moonraker's HTTP API (`printer/moonraker.py`). The printer menu
  reaches the program through `action_call_remote_method("sortering_pnp", ...)`, received over
  Moonraker's websocket (`MenuListener`). `printer/sim.py` is a full simulator (printer, parts,
  camera) used by the tests and by `sortering-pnp serve --sim`.
- **Motion safety:** every move goes through `printer/motion.py`, which applies the tool offset
  and the soft limits. `preflight()` refuses to move unless Klipper is ready, not printing, the
  hotend is cold, the axes are homed, and (for sorting, not for the Setup tab's watched moves)
  `_SORTERING_TOOL.tool == "picker"`.
- **Frames:** plate frame = screw-synth's (mm, z = 0 on the TPU top). Printer frame = G-code X/Y
  of the bed. The plate is fixed to the bed, so one 2D similarity (`transform.py`, fitted from
  marker/tip pairs) maps one to the other. Z values in sortering-pnp are printer Z of the TIP; the
  plate top is at `layout.plate_thickness_mm`.
- **Layout:** Gridfinity cells (42 mm) and bins (`layout.py`). The plate is a bin with role
  "work" (`work_marker`; a 3x3/4x4 tray): parts lie inside its walls, minus its shelf
  (`work_rect`; a corner tray keeps all of it, minus the post: `work_keepout`, used by
  `in_work`), at `surface_z()` = tray floor + TPU sheet. `resync()` infers the grid origin
  from the seen bins (any position on the bed), places bins with their `rot`, keeps unseen bins'
  settings in `away`, and picks the biggest bin as the plate unless `work_auto` is False (chosen
  by hand). Run start never re-chooses the plate. Old layouts without a plate bin use `work`
  (cut-out cells). Bins carry ArUco
  DICT_4X4_250 markers, ids 50–249 (ids below 50 are the calibration's). A marker's top
  edge = the bin's back (+Y). Two styles, told apart by the id (`binspec.style_for_marker`):
  "shelf" (100-249, the marker mid-way along a 45° back shelf) and "corner" (50-99, on a square
  post in the back-right corner, no overhang). Always get the marker's offset from the bin
  centre through `binspec.marker_offset_for(marker, own_w, own_d)`. Bin dimensions are shared in `binspec.py` by the layout and the
  printable bins.
- **Bin sizes by marker:** `binspec.SIZES` gives each printed size a fixed marker range
  (100-139 1x1x3u, 140-159 1x2x3u, 160-179 1x1x6u, 180-199 1x2x6u, 200-219 2x2x6u, 220-229
  3x3x3u tray, 230-239 4x4x3u tray, 240-249 free; corner style: 50-65, 66-73, 74-81, 82-85,
  86-89, 90-94, 95-99 for the same sizes, named e.g. `3x3x3u-corner`). A bin the camera finds gets its size, and so its rim height, from its marker. The
  ready-made plates in `prints/` come from `sortering-pnp print catalogue --out prints`; a test
  keeps them in step with the code.
- **Pi install is pinned:** `requirements-pi.lock.txt` (exact versions + hashes, generated by
  `scripts/lock_pi.py`, installed with --no-deps --require-hashes). Never add an unpinned
  dependency for the Pi; regenerate the lock instead.
- **Formats shared with screw-synth** (each side has its own code for them; change both together
  and bump the version): `parts.json` (`measure/geometry.py`: PARTS_FORMAT, PARTS_VERSION),
  `calibration.json` (`calib/`), real-photo sessions (`session.py`), `items.json` (`fill.py`).
  The keypoint order and part ids are in `naming.py`.
- **Rules:** `rules.py` (most specific rule wins; roles unknown, unsure, overflow, all, kit,
  wild). Wild bins are claimed by the first kind no rule takes (`Layout.wild_by`: part, class
  or family). A claim is committed only after a successful drop (`Planner.report`) and kept in
  `paths.claims`. At run start the camera adds unknown markers as wild bins, and unseen bins are
  left out of that run.
- **Login:** `auth.py`. PBKDF2 password hashes and session tokens (only their SHA-256 is stored)
  live in `paths.users`. `web/server.py` lets only the page and the session routes through
  without the cookie.
- **Setup:** `setup.py` keeps the checklist (`paths.setup`). `Runner.command` refuses
  start/step/auto on a real printer until it's complete. Setup moves call
  `preflight(home=False)`, so only *Home now* and sorting ever home, and they need no picker.
  Order: printer, homing, machine (then the head goes to `printer.change_position`), picker (OK =
  TOOL_PICKER), tip, lights (or "no lights"), camera, layout; tip height and camera to printer are done in their steps.
  Photos for calibration and Resync need no model (`CameraVision.analyse` reads only the codes
  then); sorting does. Machine values from the page go to `paths.machine`, over machine.yaml.
- **Picker pins:** `pins.py`. sortering-pnp switches the Pi's own pins itself (gpiozero for a
  pump, `/sys/class/pwm` for servos); the picker is not in Klipper (no host MCU, nothing to
  install). Motion sends `M400` before `grab`/`release`; `off()` on stop, error, e-stop and exit.
  The simulator has `SimPins`. Tweezers on a stepper turn through a Klipper macro
  (`picker.rotate_macro`).
- **Lights:** `leds.py`. Addressable LEDs (WS2812B ring) on the Pi's SPI MOSI (GPIO10, pin 19),
  written to /dev/spidev0.0 with the standard library (3 SPI bits per LED bit at 2.4 MHz);
  `SimLeds` in the simulator. Lit always or only for photos (`Lights.for_photo`); the Setup
  tab's Lights step sets colour and brightness (kept in `paths.machine`).
- **Grip:** `grip.py`. Screws: axis and centre of mass from the three keypoints (head_top,
  bearing, tip) plus head sizes from parts.json (`vision.shapes_from_parts`); the grip point is
  on the shank. Other parts: area moments of the outline. `Part.grip_bed` is where the tool goes;
  the tweezers' angle = `jaw_angle(axis)` (jaws close across the part; 0 deg = along X).
- **Console:** `Runner.say()`: one short line per decision (seen, pick, drop, missed, complete).
- **Picking order:** `run.order: census` (default): the most numerous class first, finished
  before the next; classes already started keep their order (`Planner.started`), so one that
  turns up again is picked first. `Plan.note` tells each change.
- **Bin fill:** `fill.py`. An item's volume: `items.json` (exact, `CatalogueVolumes`) else outline
  area x height x `run.fill.shape`; a bin's room from its Gridfinity size; packing from
  `run.fill.packing`, learnt per family from the Full button (`Packing`). Counts, volumes,
  families and learnt packing are kept with the claims (`paths.claims`). Cells are named A1
  (front-left) by `Layout.cell_name`.
- **Bin changes:** `binswap.py`. Full bins and new kinds without a free wild bin
  (`run.when_no_bin: ask`) become `BinRequest`s; the run never stops for them. OK #1 parks
  (`_parked_for_bins`), OK #2 takes a bins photo and `after_ok` decides emptied / replaced /
  removed; parts still seen in an "emptied" bin are counted (`run.check_emptied`).
- **Head camera** (optional, `camera.source: head`): `headcam.py` tiles the tray (or the grid
  and `margin_cells` around it for bins), shifts each photo by A^-1(tip - photo_position) into
  the calibration photo's frame and merges duplicates. Own model role "head", own calibration.
- **Strategies** are in `strategies.py` (sort, clear, kit). Add one by extending
  `Planner._decide` and `STRATEGIES`.
- **Models** are uploaded through the web page into a store (`models.py`, folder `paths.models`).
  Each upload gets its own folder with `sortering_pnp.json`; uploads are never overwritten. One
  model is active per role (`active.json`): stage1 (segment/obb/detect), stage2 (pose),
  classifier (classify). `analysis.py` runs them with the measurement in `measure/`. Switching
  reloads the vision setup (parts table and class list follow the stage-1 model), happens
  while idle and rolls back if loading fails. A `.pt` is a zip archive inside: only
  `.zip` uploads are unpacked.
- **The model** runs on the full calibrated ROI at its trained scale. Everything outside the
  tray's inside (and the corner post) is painted over first (`trayview.py`, `camera.mask`), the
  image size unchanged; never crop and resize to the working area: that changes the scale the
  model sees. Markers are read from the unpainted photo; the check after a bin change
  (`take_shot(paint=False)`) looks at it unpainted.

## Conventions
- Lengths in mm, speeds in mm/min, angles in degrees.
- Configuration: `configs/machine.yaml`, loaded into dataclasses (`config.py`); unknown keys are
  errors. New settings get a default and a `#` comment.
- Type hints, logging instead of print (except the CLI's user messages), no hard-coded paths.
  Tests need no hardware: use the simulator or fakes.
- The web page is one static file (`web/index.html`, plain JavaScript) plus a JSON API in
  `web/server.py` (standard library only).
