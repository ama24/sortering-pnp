"""The bed layout: a Gridfinity grid lying anywhere on the bed, with bins on it. One bin is the
plate (role "work"): a large tray (3x3, 4x4) the parts are thrown into and photographed in;
the others hold the sorted parts, each with its own marker and the rules of what it holds.

Positions are printer X/Y (the G-code frame of the bed, mm). The grid's front-left corner sits at
`origin`; cell (0, 0) is the front-left cell, x grows along printer X, y along printer Y.
`resync` sets all of it from what the camera sees: where the grid lies, which bins stand where
and which way round, and (unless chosen by hand) the biggest bin as the plate.

Older layouts without a plate bin use `work`: cells of the grid cut out of the baseplate.
