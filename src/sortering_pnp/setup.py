"""The setup checklist: what must be confirmed before the machine sorts on its own.

Until every step is done, Sort, One pick and Automatic are refused; only the setup moves are
allowed (home, jog, go to a position, the picker test, the calibration photos). Steps are
marked by hand ("it works") or automatically (tip height measured, camera calibration good
enough, bins found). Changing something they depend on un-checks them again.
