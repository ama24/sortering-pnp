"""How full a bin is: the volume of the items that went in, against the room inside the bin.

An item's volume, best first:
- the catalogue: items.json (dropped in the Files tab, made by `screwsynth-partgen items`)
  has the exact mesh volume of every catalogued item; by part number, else by class at the
  measured length, else the class average;
- generic, for any item the model segments (screws today, anything tomorrow): from what the
  camera measured, its outline area on the plate times its height, times a shape factor (a
  lying screw fills about half of that box: round shank, the head only at one end).

Loose items never fill a bin solid: the packing is the share of the room they really occupy.
It starts at run.fill.packing and is learnt from every bin marked full by hand (Packing), per
family: washers pack differently from long screws.

A bin's room comes from its Gridfinity size: the inside from the floor to the rim, without the
marker shelf or corner post. So a 1x2 bin holds twice a 1x1, and a 6-unit bin a little over
twice a 3-unit one (the floor is the same).
