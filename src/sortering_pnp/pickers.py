"""The four kinds of picker and how each is wired to the Raspberry Pi.

Everything hangs on two pins of the Pi, which sortering-pnp switches itself (pins.py): no
Klipper set-up for the picker. Every signal comes from the Pi, so the wiring is the same on any
printer (Ender 3, Prusa MK3, ...); only a pump may instead sit on the printer board's bed or
hotend output, switched by Klipper (`picker.pump_switch`, pins.py). Power comes straight from
the printer's 24 V supply: a 24 V pair to the tip, with the 5 V buck converter for the servos
there.

- GPIO12 (header pin 32), the "action" pin: jaw servo, magnet servo (hardware PWM 0), or the
  signal of a MOSFET module that switches a pump (on/off).
- GPIO13 (header pin 33), hardware PWM 1: the rotation servo (tweezers only, 0..180 degrees).
- GND (header pin 34), shared with the servos' 5 V supply and the MOSFET module.

Where a part is taken (`aim`): a suction cup or a magnet on the screw's head (flat and heavy,
it holds), tweezers at the centre of gravity, on the shank (grip.py).
