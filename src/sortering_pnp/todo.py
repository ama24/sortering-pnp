"""Things only the user can do on the real machine, listed in the Setup tab ("On the machine").

Unlike the setup steps they do not block sorting: they are reminders. Some tick themselves off
when the program notices (a calibration was dropped, a corner bin was seen, a bin was marked
Full); the others the user ticks by hand. Hand ticks are kept in paths.todo.
