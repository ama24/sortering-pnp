"""Only the tray goes to the model: everything outside the tray's inside (the walls, the bins
around it, their codes and the parts in them) and the corner post are painted over with the
colour of the tray's floor before the model looks at the photo.

The photo keeps its size and so its scale: the model sees the parts exactly as large as in its
training pictures (a plate with the parts, cut at the frame's edge where the lip is). Cropping
and resizing instead would change the scale and spoil the classes and the lengths.

The markers are read from the photo itself, never from the painted one; the check after a bin
change (are there parts left in a bin?) looks at the photo unpainted.
