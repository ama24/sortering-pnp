# Ready-made prints

Every sortering-pnp bin size as full build plates for a 220 × 220 mm bed (Ender 3), plus the
baseplate and paper labels. Each bin carries its own black-and-white code on a shelf at the
back, or on a post in its back-right corner (corner bins, below). The camera reads it to find
the bin and to know its size.

## Bin sizes

The code number tells sortering-pnp the size, so a new bin can simply be put on the bed: the
camera recognises it and knows how tall its rim is.

| Codes | Size | Use | Plates (bins per plate) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100–139 | 1 × 1 cell, 3 units (21 mm) | **sorting**, on the printer: one part number per bin | [100–115](bins/1x1x3u/bins_1x1x3u_100-115.3mf), [116–131](bins/1x1x3u/bins_1x1x3u_116-131.3mf), [132–139](bins/1x1x3u/bins_1x1x3u_132-139.3mf) (16) |
| 140–159 | 1 × 2 cells, 3 units | **sorting**: long screws, threaded rod, brackets | [140–147](bins/1x2x3u/bins_1x2x3u_140-147.3mf), [148–155](bins/1x2x3u/bins_1x2x3u_148-155.3mf), [156–159](bins/1x2x3u/bins_1x2x3u_156-159.3mf) (8) |
| 160–179 | 1 × 1 cell, 6 units (42 mm) | **storage**: small parts | [160–175](bins/1x1x6u/bins_1x1x6u_160-175.3mf), [176–179](bins/1x1x6u/bins_1x1x6u_176-179.3mf) (16) |
| 180–199 | 1 × 2 cells, 6 units | **storage**: long parts | [180–187](bins/1x2x6u/bins_1x2x6u_180-187.3mf), [188–195](bins/1x2x6u/bins_1x2x6u_188-195.3mf), [196–199](bins/1x2x6u/bins_1x2x6u_196-199.3mf) (8) |
| 200–219 | 2 × 2 cells, 6 units | **storage**: large quantities | [200–203](bins/2x2x6u/bins_2x2x6u_200-203.3mf) … [216–219](bins/2x2x6u/bins_2x2x6u_216-219.3mf) (4) |
| 220–229 | 3 × 3 cells, 3 units: a tray | **the plate**: parts are thrown in here | [220](bins/3x3x3u/bins_3x3x3u_220-220.3mf), [221](bins/3x3x3u/bins_3x3x3u_221-221.3mf) (1) |
| 230–239 | 4 × 4 cells, 3 units: a tray | **the plate** for big jobs (167 mm: fits the bed alone) | [230](bins/4x4x3u/bins_4x4x3u_230-230.3mf), [231](bins/4x4x3u/bins_4x4x3u_231-231.3mf) (1) |
| 240–249 | any other size | set by hand on the Device tab, printed from the web page | |

### Corner bins: the code on a post, nothing overhangs

The same sizes again, with the code on a square post (14 × 14 mm) in the **back-right corner**
instead of on a shelf. The post goes straight down to the floor, so no part can slide under it
and get stuck, as parts do under the 45° shelf. **Use a corner tray as the plate**, where the
parts are thrown in and spread. Shelf bins are fine for the bins that receive the sorted parts.
Both kinds can be mixed on the bed: the code number tells sortering-pnp which kind it sees and where
the bin's centre lies from its code.

| Codes | Size | Plates (bins per plate) |
|---|---|---|
| 50–65 | 1 × 1 cell, 3 units | [50–65](bins/1x1x3u-corner/bins_1x1x3u-corner_50-65.3mf) (16) |
| 66–73 | 1 × 2 cells, 3 units | [66–73](bins/1x2x3u-corner/bins_1x2x3u-corner_66-73.3mf) (8) |
| 74–81 | 1 × 1 cell, 6 units | [74–81](bins/1x1x6u-corner/bins_1x1x6u-corner_74-81.3mf) (8) |
| 82–85 | 1 × 2 cells, 6 units | [82–85](bins/1x2x6u-corner/bins_1x2x6u-corner_82-85.3mf) (4) |
| 86–89 | 2 × 2 cells, 6 units | [86–89](bins/2x2x6u-corner/bins_2x2x6u-corner_86-89.3mf) (4) |
| 90–94 | 3 × 3 cells, 3 units: **the plate** | [90](bins/3x3x3u-corner/bins_3x3x3u-corner_90-90.3mf), [91](bins/3x3x3u-corner/bins_3x3x3u-corner_91-91.3mf) (1) |
| 95–99 | 4 × 4 cells, 3 units: **the plate** for big jobs | [95](bins/4x4x3u-corner/bins_4x4x3u-corner_95-95.3mf), [96](bins/4x4x3u-corner/bins_4x4x3u-corner_96-96.3mf) (1) |

A corner tray's floor is the full inside, about 121 × 121 mm for 3 × 3: cut the TPU sheet to
that and notch out the 14 mm square of the post. If a shelf tray and a corner tray of the same
size are both on the bed, Resync takes the corner tray as the plate.

A 1 × 1 bin is 41.5 mm square, inside about 39 mm: screws up to about 35 mm long. Longer parts
(threaded rod up to 80 mm, 40-series brackets) go in 1 × 2 bins.

**To start:** the 3 × 3 corner tray 90 (the plate) and one plate of 1 × 1 sorting bins (100–115):
together they fill the default 5 × 5 layout. Add 1 × 2 bins for long parts. For big jobs use
the 4 × 4 tray. **Resync** makes the biggest bin the plate, unless you choose another.

**In the tray** lay a TPU sheet cut to its floor (about 121 × 107 mm for a 3 × 3 shelf tray, behind the
shelf): parts don't bounce and the camera sees them well. Do the camera calibration with the
board lying in the tray, at the height the parts will lie.

## Printing

- **Bins are 3MF files in two parts:** *bin* and *marker*.
  - **Multi-colour printer** (AMS, MMU…): give *marker* black and *bin* white or any light
    colour.
  - **One extruder:** print in white and add a colour change at the rim: **21 mm** for 3-unit
    bins, **42 mm** for 6-unit bins. All bins on a plate are the same height, so one change
    makes every code black.
- **Settings:** PLA, 0.2 mm layers, 2 walls, 15 % infill, no supports. The shelf under the code
  is a 45° slope and prints without supports.
- **The codes must stay sharp:** black cells of 1.6 mm. Don't scale the files.
- **Baseplate**, a plain grid: 5 × 5 cells is 210 × 210 mm, the most an Ender 3 bed takes. Lay
  it anywhere on the bed; **Resync** finds it.
  - [slim, 2.5 mm](baseplate/baseplate_5x5_slim.stl): the thinnest that still holds the bins;
  - [standard, 4.65 mm](baseplate/baseplate_5x5_standard.stl).

  The bins stand on the bed in both. Other sizes (e.g. 4 × 5) come from the Print bins tab.
- **Baseplate clamped to the whole bed:** the same 5 × 5 grid with a flat border out to the
  bed's edges, so it's held down like a glass plate. Each is cut on cell lines into 4 pieces that
  fit the printer (no socket is cut), with notches at the corners for the bed screws, and a
  README saying how to lay them out.

  | Printer | Bed | Slim (2.5 mm) | Standard (4.65 mm) |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | Creality Ender 3 / Pro / V2 | 235 × 235 mm, binder clips on every outer edge | [ender3/](baseplate/ender3/) `…_slim_*.stl` | [ender3/](baseplate/ender3/) `…_standard_*.stl` |
  | Prusa MK3 / MK3S | steel sheet 254 × 241 mm; back 10 mm free for the pins | [mk3/](baseplate/mk3/) `…_slim_*.stl` | [mk3/](baseplate/mk3/) `…_standard_*.stl` |

  On the Prusa, a **spare steel sheet** works best: stick the pieces onto it with double-sided
  tape, and the sheet snaps onto the magnetic bed in the same place every time. Binder clips also
  work, but their jaws under the sheet keep it from lying flat. Measure your bed if it isn't
  stock: the sizes are in `src/sortering_pnp/printables/beds.py`.
- **Holders for the printer's top bar** ([mounts/](mounts/)), both fixed with screws and
  T-nuts in the 2020 top bar of an Ender 3:
  - [screen_holder.stl](mounts/screen_holder.stl): an open frame for the 7" Waveshare HDMI
    LCD (H) (M2 holes 155 × 92 mm, M2 screws with heads up to 5.6 mm), leaning back 20° towards
    you. The frame is just big enough for the four holes (168 × 105 mm, a 10 mm band), so the
    display overhangs it a little all round. The Raspberry Pi stays screwed to the display's
    back where it is (it isn't centred) and sits free in the 148 × 85 mm opening, with 45 mm of
    room for it and its cables. A leg at each end stands on the bar, with one M5 in each foot
    (180 mm apart). Put it on one side of the bar.
  - [camera_arm.stl](mounts/camera_arm.stl): a slim straight arm at the bar's centre (a T
    section, 20 mm deep at the bar, 12 mm at its end), reaching 135 mm forward, with the Camera
    Module 3 right under its end (4 x M2 x 6; its cable towards the front, then up over the
    arm), as high as it goes, looking straight down at the
    bed's centre with the bed all the way out (where a print ends). 2 x M4 x 7 (heads up to
    7 mm) from the front into T-nuts, 40 mm apart, in counterbored holes the screwdriver
    reaches straight on. Printed upside down, no supports.
  - With a ring light: [camera_arm_ring.stl](mounts/camera_arm_ring.stl) (the same arm with
    four legs beside the camera), [ring_bracket.stl](mounts/ring_bracket.stl),
    [ring_clamp.stl](mounts/ring_clamp.stl) and/or [ring_diffuser.stl](mounts/ring_diffuser.stl)
    for the Opulo LumenPnP top ring light (40 mm disc, 19.9 mm hole, 8 WS2812B, a 12 mm tab
    with a 3-pin JST XH; it has no mounting holes). From the top down: arm, camera (its cable
    goes up through the slot just in front of it), bracket (the lens through its 16.4 mm
    hole), the ring, then the clamp ring or the diffuser: the ring is
    sandwiched between them (a spigot under the bracket centres it in its hole, a recess in the
    clamp or diffuser takes the board and its tab; LEDs down, the tab forward: a vertical plug
    goes up through the bracket's slot in front of the camera). The diffuser (white or clear
    PETG, a 0.6 mm window) covers the LEDs and leaves the middle open. 4 x M3 x 12 (M3 x 16
    with the diffuser) through all of them into the legs. Nothing is in the camera's view, also with the Camera Module 3 Wide.

  Your printer's sizes differ? Measure the reach (and, only for a lower camera on a post, the
  bar's height above the plate) and make your own in the web page (Print bins → Holders for the top bar) or with
  `sortering-pnp print mounts --reach … --bar-height …`. See [mounts/MOUNTS.txt](mounts/MOUNTS.txt).
- **Suction cups** ([cups/](cups/)), TPU 95A, for the suction picker. A straight Ø7 body: the
  shank goes 7 mm into the picker's socket and is held by 3 M3 screws (120° apart) in blind
  holes; a neck (20 mm or more) with the pump tube's Ø4.3 bore; **every cup is 47 mm long**, shank
  to lip, so swapping them keeps the tip height; the folds go inwards (no channel wider
  than 4.3 mm). Five tips; AM, DM and DL also as `_sieve`:
  - [cup_AS.stl](cups/cup_AS.stl), [cup_AM.stl](cups/cup_AM.stl): two stiff folds and a short
    lip (Ø4.4 / Ø6.2) for flat faces: pan, button, cheese and hex heads, nuts (M2-M3 / M4-M5).
  - [cup_DS.stl](cups/cup_DS.stl), [cup_DM.stl](cups/cup_DM.stl), [cup_DL.stl](cups/cup_DL.stl):
    four soft folds and a thin skirt (Ø5.2 / Ø7.6 / Ø10.6) for curved or tilted faces
    (M2-M3 / M3-M5 / M5-M6, M8 at a pinch).
  - `_sieve`: a dome with a ring of 3 / 5 / 9 holes (Ø1.2) on its sides instead of one hole;
    the part rests on the dome's top, 0.4 mm below the lip, so it can't plug them. AS and DS
    have none: their Ø3 cup has no room for one a 0.4 mm nozzle can print.

  Every hole is smaller than an M2's core (Ø1.57): no screw goes in. Made for a **0.4 mm
  nozzle**: every wall is two lines or more (the D skirt's edge one), every hole Ø1.2 or more,
  checked by slicing each cup. Print standing on the shank, no supports. See
  [cups/CUPS.txt](cups/CUPS.txt).
- **Labels** ([labels/](labels/)): paper codes for plain bins. Print at 100 % and glue them on
  the shelf.

For another layout (another baseplate size or more bins) the web page's **Print bins** tab
makes the matching baseplate and bins.

These files are made by `sortering-pnp print catalogue --out prints`. A test checks that they
match the code.
